# Change the bus position in virtual line to real line.
# First get the line all bus position and the line virtual situation.
# Second For every bus in the line change its position to real position.
# The change algorithms :
#      bus
#       ¡ý
#     R v v R v v v R ....
# --> line dirct
#  1. find whether the bus next station is a real station. If it's the
# bus position is the staation real index from line head(start). If not,
# go to next step.
#  2. down with the line dirct get the first real station. So the station
# real index is the bus position.
#
#¡¡ algorithms changed :
#   Down from the bus position with line direct get the first real station.
# The station's real index is the bus position.
